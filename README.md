## What is RdPro (Recursive Directory Removal Pro)

* A Recursive Directory Removal/Purge Utility.  It transverses huge directory structures to find and purge mathed directories and files buried deep. 
* Super-fast. faster than the linux "rm" command.  Multiple threads are used to perform tasks in parallel. Algorithm makes a difference! 
* Can remove a directory user specified which is nested and spread out under a huge directory structure. I found rm is lacking on this feature and it is the main driver for me to start writing this tool. For exmaple, it allows me to remove all the maven created target directories (which contains classes) under all my projects so that allows me to back up the source code only wihtout the generated classes. 
* No problem removing files and directories with long names which windows sometime can't handle.  No more â€œThe file name is too long" issue. 
* The deleted files do not go to the recycle bin and can't be recovered. Make sure you read the disclaimer and understand what to expect. 

## OS 
*  Cross platform. It is a java application and can run on all the platforms where java is supported. Requires JRE/JDK to be installed on the machine for it to run:
*  Windows 
*  Linux/Unix
*  Mac

## Tech Stack
The project is a good showcase of the 
* GUI builder with maven in IntelliJ IDEA to build a Swing GUI.
* Multi threading using java concurrent ThreadPoolExecutor to performs tasks in parallel.
* Recursive walk algorithem.

## linux/mac command line 
explode the release to [home]/bin/rdpro for example, then update jar location in the the rdpro.sh to where the jar is
such as :
       `java -jar ~/bin/rdpro/rdpro-ui.jar  "$1" "$2" "$3" "$4" "$5"`

then you can go to the directory where you want to start to delete and issue rdpro.sh 

$ rdpro.sh -h
