## What is RdPro (Rapid Delete Pro)
* How to delete large folders on Windows and Mac super fast? This tool does the job.
* It is a "rm" replacement. Only faster! and more functionality. 
* Multiple worker threads to perform delete tasks in parallel for SSD drives. Algorithm makes a difference! 
* Recursively transverses huge directory structures to seasrch and purge matched directories and files. Those to-be-deleted target directories and files could be buried deep under and spreaded across the large directory structure. I found the "rm" linux/unix command lacks this feature. It is the main driver for me to start writing this tool. For exmaple, it allows to remove all the maven created target directories (which contains the generated classes) under all my projects so that allows me to back up the source code only wihtout the generated classes. 
* No problem removing files and directories with long names which windows sometime can't handle.  No more â€œThe file name is too long" issue. 
* The deleted files do not go to the recycle bin. This is a feature and is also a reason why it is fast. However note the removed files can't be recovered from the recycle bin. If you are absolutely sure the files and directorues are to be purged, this is the right tool for the job. 

## Cross platform
*  It is a java application and can run on all the platforms where java is supported. Requires JRE/JDK to be installed on the machine for it to run. If not already availabe on your system, download and install the JDK 1.8+ from Oracle:https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/index.html
*  Windows 
*  Linux/Unix
*  Mac

## Tech Stack
The project is a good showcase of the 
* GUI builder with maven in IntelliJ IDEA to build a Swing GUI.
* Multi threading using java concurrent ThreadPoolExecutor to performs tasks in parallel.
* Recursive walk algorithem.

In the Finder, right click on a folder which you want to purge, choose Services, The Recursive Delete Pro menu should be available in the context menu. This is the name you choose to save in the Automator.  The rdpro should popup with the folder pre populated. 

For the MacMojave version, the rdpro is also avaialble at the lower right corner of the Finder's preview panel. You need to enable the "Preview" in the finder by going to the "View" menu, enable "Preview".  

**Notes:**
If you see "ERROR: java.io.IOException: Cannot run program "/Users/yourname/bin/rdpro/tools/hunlink": error=13, Permission denied", make sure the hunlink has the execute permission. go to the directory and issue the below command. Do the same for the hlink.

  >chmod 777 hunlink

### Linux/Unix/Mac command line 
Explode the release to [home]/bin/rdpro for example. Export the directory to the PATH variable so you can run it from anywhere. 
Update jar location in the the rdpro.sh to where the jar is installed if you are not using the default location,
such as :

       `java -jar ~/bin/rdpro/rdpro-ui.jar  "$1" "$2" "$3" "$4" "$5"`

then you can go to the directory where you want to start to delete and issue rdpro.sh 

$ rdpro.sh -h
