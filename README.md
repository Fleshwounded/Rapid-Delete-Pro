## What is RdPro (Recursive Directory Removal Pro)

* A Recursive Directory Removal/Purge Utility.  It transverses huge directory structures to find and purge matched directories and files that are buried deep. 
* Super-fast. faster than the linux "rm" command.  Multiple threads are used to perform tasks in parallel. Algorithm makes a difference! 
* Can remvove all the target matched directories that are nested deep under the root and spread out under a huge tree directory structure. I found rm is lacking on this feature and it is the main driver for me to start writing this tool. For exmaple, it allows me to remove all the maven created target directories (which contains classes) under all my projects so that allows me to back up the source code only wihtout the generated classes. 
* No problem removing files and directories with long names which windows sometime can't handle.  No more â€œThe file name is too long" issue. 
* The deleted files do not go to the recycle bin. This is a feature and is the reason why it is fast. However note the removed files can't be recovered from the recycle bin. If you are absolutely sure the files and directorues are to be purged, this is the right tool for the job. 

## OS 
*  Cross platform. It is a java application and can run on all the platforms where java is supported. Requires JRE/JDK to be installed on the machine for it to run. If not already availabe on your system, download and install the JDK 1.8+ from Oracle:https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/index.html
*  Windows 
*  Linux/Unix
*  Mac

## Tech Stack
The project is a good showcase of the 
* GUI builder with maven in IntelliJ IDEA to build a Swing GUI.
* Multi threading using java concurrent ThreadPoolExecutor to performs tasks in parallel.
* Recursive walk algorithem.

## How to install and run

Requires JRE/JDK to be installed on the machine for it to run. If not already availabe on your system, download and install the JDK 1.8+ from Oracle:https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/index.html

see below on how to add the customized "rdpro" action to Finder's extension or right click context menu. 

If you see "ERROR: java.io.IOException: Cannot run program "/Users/yourname/bin/rdpro/tools/hunlink": error=13, Permission denied", make sure the hunlink has the execute permission. go to the directory and issue the below command. Do the same for the hlink.

  >chmod 777 hunlink

* for the "Pass input",  select "as arguments"
* Type in the script as shown on the screenshot.
* Save as "rdpro" for example or give your own name. This is the name going to be displayed in Finder preview. 

In the Finder, right click on a folder which you want to purge, choose Services, The Recursive Delete Pro menu should be available in the context menu. This is the name you choose to save in the Automator.  The rdpro should popup with the folder pre populated.

### Linux/Unix/Mac command line 
Explode the release to [home]/bin/rdpro for example. Export the directory to the PATH variable so you can run it from anywhere. 
Update jar location in the the rdpro.sh to where the jar is installed if you are not using the default location,
such as :

       `java -jar ~/bin/rdpro/rdpro-ui.jar  "$1" "$2" "$3" "$4" "$5"`

then you can go to the directory where you want to start to delete and issue rdpro.sh 

$ rdpro.sh -h
